# Bottles, Cans, or Drafts: Pouring Over the Data to Decode the Perfect Sip

## Abstract
In this dive into the beer world, our project seeks to figure out the subtle differences that various ways of serving—bottle, can, and draft—bring to beer reviews. We're curious about what makes people like one style over another. Why? Because beer fans are all about their personal choices, and we want to know if the container affects how they rate and describe the brew.  
By closely looking at a dataset of beer reviews, we want to spot any connections or trends that show how serving styles might sway the overall rating and what people say about the beer. As we take on this bubbly quest, we hope to quench the thirst for understanding how picking between a bottle, can, or draft might shape how beer lovers feel. 

## Research questions
In this analysis, we would like to answer the following questions:
* Does a particular serving type consistently receive higher or lower ratings compared to others?
  
* Are certain types of beers more frequently associated with a specific serving style?
  
* Do regional preferences influence the choice of a specific serving style in different parts of the world or the US?

## Methods
In order to find answers to these questions, we will use the following data analysis pipeline.

### Part 1: Getting to Know the Data

*Step 1: Preparing the Data*  
Some datasets were initially provided as txt files. We created a function to read these files line by line, converting their content into dictionaries. These dictionaries were then saved as CSV files for simplified access.

*Step 2: Exploring Each Dataset*  
We carefully examined the contents of each dataset, streamlining them by removing unnecessary columns and ensuring any missing values were appropriately filled.

*Step 3: Building the Master Dataset*  
To facilitate seamless analysis, we merged all the datasets into one comprehensive dataset. This amalgamated dataset was also saved as a CSV file, ensuring efficiency in subsequent stages of our work.

### Part 2: Data Enrichment

*Step 4: Serving Type Classification*  
We initiated the serving type classification by creating a sample of 250 reviews. This sample underwent manual classification to assess the accuracy of various classifying algorithms, aiding us in determining the most suitable approach. Subsequently, we applied the chosen algorithm to the entire dataset. Our approach first consists in applying a rule-based function to the tokenized reviews, according to grammar and syntax rules. Here there will be a trade-off between the accuracy of the function and the run time that can be consequent when adding extra rules. 

This is the function as of now:
<hr style="clear:both">

**Input :**  Textual review
<hr style="clear:both">

$bottle \gets (\text{'bottle'}, \text{bottled'}, \text{'bottles'}, \text{'bomber'})$\
$can \gets (\text{'can'}, \text{'canned'}, \text{'cans'})$\
$draft \gets (\text{'draft'}, \text{'tap'}, \text{draught'}, \text{'taps'}, \text{'cask'}, \text{'growler'})$

$tokens \gets \text{nlp}(review)$\
$servings  \gets \text{empty set}$\
$serving \gets$ None

for $token$ in $tokens :$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if $token$ in $bottle :$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $servings \gets \text{'bottle'}$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if $token$ in $can :$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $servings \gets \text{'can'}$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if $token$ in $draft :$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $servings \gets \text{'draft'}$

if $\text{length}(servings) \neq 1:$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $serving \gets \text{'unknown'}$\
$\text{else}:$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $serving \gets \text{string}(servings)$
<hr style="clear:both">

**Output :** serving style
<hr style="clear:both">

Please note that this function was written following very basic rules. It is subject to evolution in Milestone P3, where we want to look at the tense of the sentences and other grammatical rules to achieve a better extraction.

*Step 5: Additional Review Metrics*  
In this step, we computed additional metrics for each review, including readability score, polarity, and subjectivity. They might be used to extract the serving styles as well and perform a majority vote with the other methods for more robustness.

### Part 3: Analysis and answering the scientific questions *(TBD in Milestone 3)*

*Step 6: Check representation of dataset*\
Given that the dataset employed for analyses only uses reviews where a serving style has been specified, there is a substantial reduction in dataset size. (With the current methodology, approximately 57% of the original dataset has an unknown serving style.) It is imperative, therefore, to ensure that the utilized dataset remains representative of the initial dataset.

To achieve this, we propose to analyse the average score of beers. If the rating of the beer does not change significantly after the filtering, it means our dataset is representative of the initial one. Significant differences may be a sign of a shift in the distribution of the data.

*Step 7: Analyse the influence of serving style*\
This step is the core of our analysis. The goal is to use the enriched dataset and look at patterns between serving style. 

1. <u>Association of Beer Types:</u> Investigate whether specific types of beers exhibit a trend to be associated more frequently with a particular serving style. This exploration may reveal intriguing patterns in consumer preferences and shed light on the links between beer characteristics and serving methods.

2. <u>Regional Preferences:</u> Look into the influence of regional factors on the choice of serving styles in different geographical areas, globally or within the United States. This involves assessing whether location impact the preferences for bottle, can, or draft.

3. <u>Rating Disparities:</u>
Conduct an in-depth examination to analyse whether particular serving styles consistently have higher or lower ratings in comparison to others. The knowledge gained from the previous analysis should help us retrieve valuable information, and be more careful with association.
The different ratings critera will be used such as: appearance, aroma, palate, taste	or overall rating. The use of Confidence Interval and t-statistic, will help us to know whether the differences are significative.
